                    <p>Hi, My name is Ronnie Bruce Gregory. My wife's name was Rebecca, Jo Martin Gregory. She went home to be with her Lord September 10, 2016. We ministered to churches in 3 different states together for over 45 years. I attended Sunset School Peaching in Lubbock, Texas and have been preaching for more than 52 years now. I have been blessed to be preaching and ministering to the First Christian Church in Elgin, Texas for the last 15 years come Oct. 11, 2024. I preach and teach from the Bible only. I pray and strive with my very being to do it with love and honesty to honor God only.</p>
